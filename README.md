The repository contains the following folders:  
- client_side_files: this folder contains the Xamarin application source files only (it does NOT contain the Visual Studio project files -- just the source code).  
- server_side_files: this folder contains two folders: "application_web_service_files" and "create_request_webpage_files". These folders contain the files that will be hosted on the Apache HTTP server.  
- DB Scripts: this folder contains the scripts used to create the SQL database and its tables.
