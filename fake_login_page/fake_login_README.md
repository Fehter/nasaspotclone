These are the source code files used for the fake login page.  
Almost all of this code is from "templates" that can be created through Visual Studio.  

NOTE: These files work for a Visual Studio project named "test_xamarin_app".  
If you look at the top each .xaml source file, you should see the a line similar to the one found in ListViewPage1.xaml's ContentPage attributes:  

"x:Class="test_xamarin_app.ListViewPage1"  

If your Visual Studio project's name is not "test_xamarin_app", you will get errors.  
This is also the case for .xaml.cs files except there you will have to change the string after "namespace".  
"namespace" appears just after the "using" statements at the beginning of the file.
